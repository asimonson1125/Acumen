# Acumen
A Discord bot focused on statistical insight and role management

**Disclosure:** This bot is not (and won't be) designed for use outside of the servers that I am in so that I can help manage it, but I did want to make it open source in case there is a function you want to pull for your own use.

## Uses:
 - catch invis posters

 - enables bot owner to identify all channels in servers (perms not needed) and post in those channels as the bot (perms needed)
