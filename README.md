# Acumen
A Discord bot focused on statistical insight and role management

**Disclosure:** This bot is not (and won't be) designed for use outside of the servers that I am in so that I can help manage it, but I did want to make it open source in case there is a function you want to pull for your own use.

## Uses:
 - simulate [NationsGame](https://nationsgame.net) battles and predict victors (forked from [rolls simulator](https://github.com/asimonson1125/NG-Rolls-Simulator))

 - find most recent action of NG users
![channel message](/images/act.PNG)
 - enables bot owner to identify all channels in servers (perms not needed) and post in those channels as the bot (perms needed)
